## About

For this project, I wanted to create a game that can be added to the portfolio. I present to you my first Py game, Dice Game.

## What I learned

.: Py Libraries :.

    # import random library
    import random

    # import time library
    import time
---

## Delay of time
place a delay upon the code.

    time.sleep(1)
    

## How To RUN the game.
 - Open Terminal to directory of file
 - python3 app.py 
 - Enjoy
